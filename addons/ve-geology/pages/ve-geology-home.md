## Volcanoes and Earthquakes

Earth is a restless planet. Beneath our feet, tectonic plates grind against one another,
magma surges toward the surface, and the ground shakes with energy released from hundreds
of kilometers below. This site brings together the best available open data to help you
explore that activity — from the ancient calderas of the Pleistocene to volcanoes erupting
right now.

## Volcanoes

The [Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program (GVP)](https://volcano.si.edu/) maintains the
world's most comprehensive catalog of volcanic activity — more than 2,600 volcanoes
documented across the Holocene and Pleistocene epochs, with eruption histories stretching
back thousands of years.

## Earthquakes

The [USGS Earthquake Hazards Program](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) monitors seismic
activity globally. This site tracks significant earthquakes and identifies those occurring
within 50 km of a known volcano — a relationship that can signal volcanic unrest.
