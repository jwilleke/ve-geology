# ve-geology

Volcano and geology data platform built as an [ngdpbase](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase) add-on.
Powered by [Global Volcanism Program (GVP)](https://volcano.si.edu/) volcano data,
[USGS Earthquake Hazards Program](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) feeds, and
[USGS HANS](https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/hans-public/api/) real-time volcano alerts.

## What it does

- Imports 2,600+ GVP volcano and eruption records into a local JSON snapshot
- Imports USGS earthquake data matched to the nearest volcano within 50 km
- Imports real-time US volcano alert levels from USGS HANS
- Registers seven wiki markup plugins (infoboxes, tables, search widgets, Leaflet maps, alert tables)
- Seeds demo wiki pages into your ngdpbase instance automatically on first load
- Exposes a REST API at `/api/ve-geology/*`

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jwilleke/ve-geology.git
cd ve-geology
npm install
npm run import:all && npm run import:earthquakes && npm run import:hans
```

Then wire to ngdpbase and restart — see [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for full instructions.
