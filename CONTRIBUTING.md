## Getting Started

See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for complete installation and setup instructions including prerequisites, cloning, dependency installation, environment configuration, and verification steps.

## Development Workflow

### Read Project Context First

Before starting work, read `AGENTS.md` to understand:

- Project goals and current status
- Architecture and tech stack
- Known blockers or issues
- Priority tasks

Use the slash command:

```bash
/context
```

### Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Branch naming: `type/description`

### Make Changes

Follow [CODE_STANDARDS.md](./CODE_STANDARDS.md) for all code conventions including TypeScript strict mode, naming conventions, formatting rules, and the DRY principle.

## Making Changes

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
npm run lint        # Check for issues
npm run lint:fix    # Auto-fix issues
npm run format      # Format with Prettier
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run test              # Run tests
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage     # Check coverage
```

## Commit Guidelines

**All commit messages must follow the format specified in [CODE_STANDARDS.md - Git Commit Messages](./CODE_STANDARDS.md#git-commit-messages).**

This includes:

- Conventional commits format (type, scope, description)
- Required types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`
- Pre-commit hooks that enforce linting standards

## Pull Requests

### Before Creating a PR

1. Update branch: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/master`
2. Run tests: `npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build`
3. Update [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) if making significant changes
